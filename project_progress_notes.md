# power_outage_exposure_simulation progress notes 

Nov 6th:
- sent draft to everyone
- need to fix tables and potentially fix plots so that they are prettier 
- can use vivian's table idea to make them prettier: first row is one color, 
everything else is blank, and the lines are bold in between 

- wait on feedback from coauthors then submit
color palette ideas:

Oct 18th:

- fixed county id issue up until b02_clean_exposure_data_with_missingness
- need to deal with county id type issues in cleaning scripts
- need to save customers served file somewhere in pipeline so it's easy to read 
in when creating outcome data 
- need to update/write run_all scripts. 

This is the document where we write what we did, transcribe meeting notes, and 
write next steps.
