# power_outage_exposure_simulation progress notes 

December 12th:

- need to fix the simulation code so that it's well-organized and automated when it can be
- everything is internally consistent for now, but we may need to rerun the simulation once more, 
with updated code and everything organized so that it's really reproducible
- there's also that comment marianthi made about how the manuscript slightly misrepresents how we drew counts of customers out
- want to fix that in revisions, and be able to re-generate plots 
- that's the next big thing for this. 

Nov 6th:
- sent draft to everyone
- need to fix tables and potentially fix plots so that they are prettier 
- can use vivian's table idea to make them prettier: first row is one color, 
everything else is blank, and the lines are bold in between 

- wait on feedback from coauthors then submit
color palette ideas:

Oct 18th:

- fixed county id issue up until b02_clean_exposure_data_with_missingness
- need to deal with county id type issues in cleaning scripts
- need to save customers served file somewhere in pipeline so it's easy to read 
in when creating outcome data 
- need to update/write run_all scripts. 

This is the document where we write what we did, transcribe meeting notes, and 
write next steps.
