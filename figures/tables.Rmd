## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:





## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}



cc <- read_rds(here(
  'results',
  'simulation_model_output',
  'results_all_missingness_CC.RDS'
)) |> setDT() |> 
  filter(!is.na(estimate))

# extract info from model labels
cc[, `:=`(
  percent_affected = sub(".*_(\\d+\\.?\\d*)p_.*", "\\1", outcome),
  percent_missing = sub(".*_missing_(\\d+)_.*", "\\1", outcome),
  effect_size = sub(".*_(\\d+\\.?\\d*p)$", "\\1", outcome)
)]

# fix none missing case
cc[, `:=`(
  percent_affected = ifelse(
    grepl("outcome_exposed_8_hrs_0.005_none_missing", outcome),
    0,
    percent_affected
  ),
  percent_missing = ifelse(
    grepl("outcome_exposed_8_hrs_0.005_none_missing", outcome),
    0,
    percent_missing
  )
)]

# Ensure percent_affected and percent_missing are factors with the desired order
cc$percent_affected <- factor(cc$percent_affected, levels = c("80", "50", "20"))
cc$percent_missing <- factor(cc$percent_missing, levels = c("20", "50", "80"))

# map effect_size to numeric values
cc[, effect := case_when(
  effect_size == '5p' ~ 0.05,
  effect_size == '1p' ~ 0.01,
  effect_size == '0.5p' ~ 0.005
)]

# calculate bias 
cc[, percent_bias := ((estimate - effect)/effect) * 100]

cc <- cc %>% mutate(
  effect_size = case_when(
    effect_size == '0.5p' ~ ".5% increase",
    effect_size == '1p' ~ "1% increase",
    effect_size == '5p' ~ "5% increase"
  )
)



coverage <- 
  cc %>%
  mutate(covered = ifelse(effect < upper_ci & effect > lower_ci, 1, 0))

coverage <-
  coverage %>%
  group_by(percent_missing, percent_affected, effect_size) %>%
  summarize(mean_percent_bias = mean(percent_bias),
            coverage = mean(covered)*100)

o <- coverage %>% filter(percent_missing == 80) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = c(percent_missing, percent_affected), values_from = c(mean_percent_bias, coverage))

o %>% knitr::kable()

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
